          <h1>*Monday Blues*</h1>
          <h5>2/17/20</h5>
          <p>The ‘Monday Blues’ seem to wrap their cold, unforgiving arms around me each and every Monday. Why is that? I try to wake up and think positive thoughts. “Hey, it’s a brand-new day and a brand-new week with new opportunities and endless possibilities! Go pursue them, Jen!” I try to say this with much enthusiasm. I turn onto my side and switch on the SAD light on my nightstand (seasonal affective disorder light therapy, in case you were wondering!) and some music. It’s 4:15am. Fifteen minutes before I have to drag myself out of bed and into my morning routine. It helps until I actually leave the house and step foot into my workplace. Then, all of those warm, positive vibes go right out the window. UGH. <br>
            I sit at my desk and sulk, wishing I was anywhere but here. I begin to daydream about lounging on a beach, watching the ocean waves crash over and over again and soaking in the sunshine. I’d prefer to be anywhere but here. <br>
            It wasn’t until after work that I truly smiled. And, it didn’t take much. It actually caught me by surprise. I stopped at the gas station for Mega Millions and Powerball tickets (yup, I’m going to win the lottery one day) and brought my pre-selected number slips up to the cashier so she could print out my tickets. <br>
            “How’s your day going so far?” The girl behind the counter asks this cheerfully AND genuinely before she runs my tickets. She turns her head waiting for me to answer. She’s adorable with curly hair and fashionable glasses and she can’t be any older than 20. “I, um, it’s going okay. Thankfully, my Monday is over,” I respond. Geez, I feel like a little rain cloud amidst her sunshine. She smiles back. “I’ve actually had a good Monday. I got a promotion at my other job.” <br>
            In that moment, I realized the power of even a small interaction. I’ve always despised the mundane “Hi, how are you?” and “I’m good” responses in a hurried fashion. The kind where people pass each other in a hallway and just fill the air with emotionless words.  <br>
            I stopped. I relaxed. There was no line behind me and there was no need to rush. I smiled back. Gave her a big, genuine smile and asked where she worked and what she did. Then, I congratulated her. And, you know what? It felt really good. It felt good to be kind and happy for a person that I didn’t even know. <br>
            After a couple of minutes of small talk, I said goodbye to my new cashier friend and walked out to the car. I paused before I opened the door, closed my eyes and took a deep, refreshing breath. Just then, the sun began shining small rays of light from the gloomy sky. I decided then and there that this Monday wouldn’t hold me captive any longer. I hopped in the car and drove off, the music cranked up, my spirits high, singing along with the enthusiasm I had been looking for earlier in the day. It felt good to find it.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Question for my readers: How do you try to make even the smallest interactions a positive experience, even on the gloomiest of days?</strong><br>

          <h1>*Dreams*</h1>
          <h5>2/13/20</h5>
          <img class="img1" src="images/diaryPics/diaryOneBeach.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Have you ever had a dream? A dream that no matter how silly you think it is, you cannot stop thinking about it. The type of dream that when you think of it waking up each morning, it makes your heart flutter? It gives you hope going to a job where you do the same repetitive things each and every day. You lack motivation and enthusiasm and you work with people that drive you absolutely nuts. You think about your dream and get excited and envision yourself doing something with passion and changing your life. Maybe even changing the lives of others around you and inspiring them, too?<br>
            That’s a dream. Chase it. No matter how far off or impossible it feels. Life is too damn short. <br>
            I want to write. Share stories. Even if they are the shortest of stories, I want them to make a positive impact on those that read them. I want to make people smile, laugh and cry. Encourage them to reply “Me, too” and share THEIR stories. Then, we can all connect. We can come together, make new friends, improve our lives and make this world a better place. One story and one person at a time. Because the truth is, each of us is made up of many stories. These stories make us who we are. <br>
            (Side note) I also want to be able to quit my job and do this from a lounge chair on the beach with a margarita in hand. I’m not going to lose hope of that, either…  :) <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Question for my readers: Do you have a dream?  What have you done to pursue it when it seems out of reach?</strong>
