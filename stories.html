          <h1>~A Valentine Sign~</h1>
          <h5>3/15/2020</h5>
          <img class="img3" src="images/storypics/sotry2.jpg" alt="">
          <p>

            Not long after I “toasted” my Dad’s (early) birthday on the night before Valentine’s Day to the Christmas
            tree that still stood brightly lit in my living room, I decided to tackle the pile of dishes in my kitchen
            that I had neglected for the past few days. One of my best girlfriends would be joining me for dinner the
            following afternoon for Valentine’s Day and I wanted to show her I could live like a decent human being.<br>
            Filled with mixed emotions of missing my loved one, sadness, anticipation for company and irritation with my
            own laziness and mess of a kitchen, I began tidying and putting things away. <br>
            I’ve lived in my house for a year and three months now. All of the cupboards were completely empty and wiped
            down on the inside (& out). I have to say, my kitchen is pretty organized and I could name every item (big
            and small) in any given cupboard and cubby. My friend coming the next day could attest to that, as she
            helped me in my kitchen upon moving and settling in.<br>
            As I swung a lower cupboard open to shove the toaster inside, where it had been put countless times in its
            own space by itself, an item flew out, hit the floor, bounced and fell directly at my feet. It was shiny and
            beautiful. Much more so than the bread crumbs that usually fell off the shelf.<br>
            I set the toaster down and picked up what fell to my feet. In my hand, was a Hershey kiss. And, it wasn’t
            just a kiss, it was a “hug”. Though it had fallen from the cupboard and bounced, the tag from the top of the
            kiss was in near perfect condition...just one minor crinkle. <br>
            Now maybe you’d think nothing of this. But, I do. I know because I don’t like the mixed white and milk
            chocolate of a hug. And, I’ve never even thought to buy or bring a bag of them into my house, let alone
            one.<br>
            Yet, somehow, one made its way inside. In an empty cupboard alongside a toaster. Before a day when I miss my
            Dad the most. <br>
            It might sound simple. It might sound crazy. But, after many thoughts of “If I could just HUG him one more
            time”....even saying it out loud, it might seem like perfect sense. On a day most recognized with LOVE. Love
            shown as simply as giving a hug to someone missed very much. On a day called Valentine’s Day. <br>
            I would call this my “Valentine Sign”.

          <h1>Trust In Me (A Sign of Hope)</h1>
          <h5>3/15/2020</h5>
          <img class="img2" src="images/storypics/mountain_story2.jpg" alt="">
          <p>

            The sky was getting darker by the minute. I walked up to the old, rusted red pickup truck and opened the
            door. As I slid in onto the seat, my dog Rudy, was already there, waiting to go for a ride. <br>
            I began the slow drive uphill, which was a gravel road around a very TALL mountain. As the road wound around
            this mountain and I got higher in elevation, I noticed dead trees laying everywhere on the mountainside. As
            the sky became black, I couldn't help but think how eerie the scene was, but I kept driving. I wanted to
            turn around; go back where I'd be safe. Instead, I stepped on the accelerator and drove on. I had to get to
            the end of the road, at the top of the mountain.<br>
            Suddenly, I noticed movement off to my left. I stopped the truck. The dead trees began sliding off the
            mountain side and into the road ahead, forming a large log-jam. I looked to my right and it was an extremely
            high drop off. There was nowhere to go. I put the truck in park. I stared at the log-jam helplessly. <br>
            Before I could react, the log-jam broke. Water from somewhere had been building up behind it, and all of its
            weight, power and fury came racing down the road at me. I knew this was it. My life was over. I looked down
            at Rudy and he gazed at me with those beautiful brown eyes. I kissed him on his forehead like I always did.
            Then I faced forward with tears streaming down my face.<br>
            As I prepared for the "end", I could see something off to my right in the sky. Black clouds began swirling
            around a white, glowing object. A VERY WHITE, lit up "sign" lowered from the sky slowly. Time seemed to
            stand still. I felt a sense of peace, even though I had danger ahead. As I focused my vision on the sign, I
            could see there was a message. <br>
            In the most beautiful cursive writing I'd ever seen in my life it read: "Trust In Me."<br>
            I forgot about the logs, the rushing water, the dark sky, the very high drop off to my right. But, for some
            reason, I was out of breath.........<br>
            -------------------------------------------<br>
            I woke up breathing heavily, as if I’d sprinted a 100 meter dash. Tears streamed down the sides of my face.
            I quickly sat up in bed. The room was so still, so very quiet. So peaceful. Rudy lay next to me, looking up
            at me. He had been startled awake by my quick movement. He lay his head down and went back to sleep. <br>
            What a powerful dream I had just woken from! Goosebumps appeared up and down my arms. What day was it? My
            mind was racing. <br>
            I suddenly realized what the date was. It was exactly two years from the date of my dad’s tragic passing. A
            day that had changed my life forever. A day that would be engraved in my mind, down to every last detail.
            The day he decided to take his own life. I had been struggling to understand why and pick up the pieces and
            move forward for these past two years. I had never experienced such depression, sadness and darkness.<br>
            I began to cry. Cry for the pain and sadness my dad must have felt before he left. Cry that I would never
            see him again and the milestones he would miss. Cry for my own pain and suffering. <br>
            Then, I stopped crying. Maybe this dream was a sign of hope? Maybe, just maybe, someone was trying to tell
            me that everything was going to be okay? I had been praying so much lately. Praying for the strength to move
            forward with my life. To somehow find a way to live without my dad and find happiness until we would meet up
            again. I wanted to believe it. I wanted to get my life back on track. I couldn’t live like this anymore.<br>
            There had been countless days where it was so painful to get out of bed. Days I couldn’t even find the
            energy to smile or find joy in even the simplest things. The people closest to me had noticed this. They
            didn’t know what to do to help. I had felt so alone up to this point.<br>
            I threw back the covers and sat up straight. I knew what I needed to do. I had to move forward. One little
            step at a time. One day at a time, just as long as I was moving ahead and not backwards. I stood up. My feet
            were planted on the cold hardwood floor. I could picture the sign “Trust in Me” from my dream. I pictured it
            ahead of me. I could hear a soft whisper in my ear. “Trust in Me, Jennifer.” <br>
            I shivered. I took a step forward. And another one. <br>
            “I TRUST you,” I whispered back.

          <h1>A John Deere Surprise</h1>
          <h5>3/14/2020</h5>
          <img class="img1" src="images/storypics/story1.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Today was my dad's BEST friend's birthday. His friend, Brad, and I have become much closer since my dad's
            passing, and this year, I made it a point to call him FIRST thing, on his special day.<br>
            "Happy Birthday, Brad!", I cheerily said into the phone at 7:15am, when he answered. "Jenni, you made my
            day, thank you so much!" He was shocked I remembered. As I hung up the phone, I said out loud, "Dad, it's
            your Buddy Bwad's birthday (we call Brad, "Bwad"). Not that you need me to remind you, but just saying."<br>
            Hours later, Brad texted me a picture that would stun us both. Typically, Brad works north of Two Harbors,
            about 40 miles. For the first time this summer, he was sent to help in Two Harbors where my dad both worked
            and lived. And, of all days, Brad’s birthday.<br>
            As Brad pulled out of a gravel pit in his work truck, there sat my Dad's old tractor, (sold years prior)
            parked in a random driveway, out in the open for Brad to see. And, of all days, his birthday. Brad, shocked,
            pulled over and had to take a picture, which he texted me. I called him right away.
            He told me how his day was made by my call. He had a wonderful day and he thought about my Dad, sister and I
            all day, and how much he missed my dad, when the tractor appeared out of nowhere.<br>
            I waited for (and hoped) what I would hear Brad say next. "A couple of things have puzzled me after I have
            talked to you girls. Occurrences. But not like this. Now, I know that's him. That's gotta be your dad!"
            Then, he just laughed, such a hearty, healthy laugh! Of course, I couldn't help but tear up. And, smile a
            BIG smile, while shaking my head. I knew in my heart instantly, who it was, who somehow made this happen.
            In 10 days, it will be my Dad's 2-year anniversary of his passing. He left much too soon, but since then,
            continues to show signs to his loved ones, which let us know he's at peace, he's watching, and waiting....to
            surprise the heck out of us!<br><br>

            Love and miss you SO much, Dad!
