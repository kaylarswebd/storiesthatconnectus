          <h1>~A Valentine Sign~</h1>
          <h5>3/15/2020</h5>
          <img class="img2" src="images/storypics/sotry2.jpg" alt="">
          <p>

            Not long after I “toasted” my Dad’s (early) birthday on the night before Valentine’s Day to the Christmas tree that still stood brightly lit in my living room, I decided to tackle the pile of dishes in my kitchen that I had neglected for the past few days. One of my best girlfriends would be joining me for dinner the following afternoon for Valentine’s Day and I wanted to show her I could live like a decent human being. <br>
            
            Filled with mixed emotions of missing my loved one, sadness, anticipation for company and irritation with my own laziness and mess of a kitchen, I began tidying and putting things away. <br>
            
            I’ve lived in my house for a year and three months now. All of the cupboards were completely empty and wiped down on the inside (& out). I have to say, my kitchen is pretty organized and I could name every item (big and small) in any given cupboard and cubby. My friend coming the next day could attest to that, as she helped me in my kitchen upon moving and settling in.<br>
            
            As I swung a lower cupboard open to shove the toaster inside, where it had been put countless times in its own space by itself, an item flew out, hit the floor, bounced and fell directly at my feet. It was shiny and beautiful. Much more so than the bread crumbs that usually fell off the shelf.<br>
            
            I set the toaster down and picked up what fell to my feet. In my hand, was a Hershey kiss. And, it wasn’t just a kiss, it was a “hug”. Though it had fallen from the cupboard and bounced, the tag from the top of the kiss was in near perfect condition...just one minor crinkle. <br>
            
            Now maybe you’d think nothing of this. But, I do. I know because I don’t like the mixed white and milk chocolate of a hug. And, I’ve never even thought to buy or bring a bag of them into my house, let alone one.<br>
            
            Yet, somehow, one made its way inside. In an empty cupboard alongside a toaster. Before a day when I miss my Dad the most. <br>
            
            It might sound simple. It might sound crazy. But, after many thoughts of “If I could just HUG him one more time”....even saying it out loud, it might seem like perfect sense. On a day most recognized with LOVE. Love shown as simply as giving a hug to someone missed very much. On a day called Valentine’s Day. <br>
            
            I would call this my “Valentine Sign”.

          <h1>A John Deere Surprise</h1>
          <h5>3/14/2020</h5>
          <img class="img1" src="images/storypics/story1.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Today was my dad's BEST friend's birthday. His friend, Brad, and I have become much closer since my dad's
            passing, and this year, I made it a point to call him FIRST thing, on his special day.<br>
            "Happy Birthday, Brad!", I cheerily said into the phone at 7:15am, when he answered. "Jenni, you made my
            day, thank you so much!" He was shocked I remembered. As I hung up the phone, I said out loud, "Dad, it's
            your Buddy Bwad's birthday (we call Brad, "Bwad"). Not that you need me to remind you, but just saying."<br>
            Hours later, Brad texted me a picture that would stun us both. Typically, Brad works north of Two Harbors,
            about 40 miles. For the first time this summer, he was sent to help in Two Harbors where my dad both worked
            and lived. And, of all days, Brad’s birthday.<br>
            As Brad pulled out of a gravel pit in his work truck, there sat my Dad's old tractor, (sold years prior)
            parked in a random driveway, out in the open for Brad to see. And, of all days, his birthday. Brad, shocked,
            pulled over and had to take a picture, which he texted me. I called him right away.
            He told me how his day was made by my call. He had a wonderful day and he thought about my Dad, sister and I
            all day, and how much he missed my dad, when the tractor appeared out of nowhere.<br>
            I waited for (and hoped) what I would hear Brad say next. "A couple of things have puzzled me after I have
            talked to you girls. Occurrences. But not like this. Now, I know that's him. That's gotta be your dad!"
            Then, he just laughed, such a hearty, healthy laugh! Of course, I couldn't help but tear up. And, smile a
            BIG smile, while shaking my head. I knew in my heart instantly, who it was, who somehow made this happen.
            In 10 days, it will be my Dad's 2-year anniversary of his passing. He left much too soon, but since then,
            continues to show signs to his loved ones, which let us know he's at peace, he's watching, and waiting....to
            surprise the heck out of us!<br><br>

            Love and miss you SO much, Dad!
          </p>
