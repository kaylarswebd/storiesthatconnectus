          <h1>About Me</h1>          
          <img src="images/aboutMeFacePictue.jpg" alt="">         
          <p>I have always been a storyteller at heart. Since I was young, I enjoyed expressing different kinds of emotions and describing the details of real-life experiences (the good, the bad AND the ugly), whether it was in front of a group of family, friends, co-workers, or one on one in an intimate setting. More than ever, writing and putting ideas down on paper has become one of my most fulfilling hobbies. It’s like therapy to me. I have kept a journal of my day to day experiences and feelings on and off for many years of my life. It has helped me figure things out. It has also been extremely entertaining to look back on after many years have passed, especially when it comes to areas of my life where I have really grown and matured since the documented experience. I have read back on many different times in my life and could still embrace the feelings that I felt; anger, happiness, joy, love, anxiety, jealousy, sadness and loneliness. These experiences taught me many lessons and that was important to me. It is important that I learned from these experiences to make my life better because of it.</p>
          <p>What I have learned through this process and in sharing with others is that we are all made up of many stories. These stories are what build us into the people we are and have an impact on ourselves and the lives of others, when we decide to share them. It is also how we connect. Throughout my life, I have learned how much I love to connect with others about life’s lessons, adventures and experiences. There is so much comfort in sitting around a table with friends or meeting a stranger and realizing that we share something in common, spark a connection and have an awesome conversation that we will remember for a very long time, if not forever. We all have something to share and that is valuable. I also think it is so important to be able to get something from these connections and stories, to improve our lives moving forward and learn to be a better person because of it. I have found myself, at times, beginning to write stories in my head of the things that have happened to me or what I have learned and heard from others. </p>
          <p>Which brings me to the present day. Blogging has become extremely popular. I know a few people who have started blogs. I thought it would be a new and exciting way to log my experiences and to also share some of the stories I have written. Why not give it a shot?</p> 
          <p>My personal blog is true to the person I am and reflects my day to day activities. I enjoy the simple things in life. I love to laugh, be silly and try to see the positive in most situations. The stories, well, that is a different story. These are a collection of stories that have impacted my life in some way or another. Some are my own personal stories, some stories of friends, stories of neighbors and colleagues and stories of complete strangers. Regardless, these stories have meaning to me. I will also protect the identity of those stories that are not mine. The important thing is that each story has a lesson within it. Can you find it? Can you relate? How can you apply what you learn to your own life?</p>
          <p>A couple of things about me: I am a proud dog mom of a 12-year-old shih tzu named Rudaford Montgomery (Rudy). He’s been my “fur-baby” and best friend all of these years and I love him dearly, though he has tested every ounce of patience that I have and when I call him a “spoiled brat with an attitude” I realize there’s no one to really blame but me. It is a good thing I decided to not have kids of my own! Ha! This world would be in a lot of trouble!</p>  
          <p>I’m a lover of: long walks, a deliciously chilled Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, listening to music, singing, dancing, taking pictures (I currently have over 9,000 pictures on my phone and think it’s time to finally invest in a nice camera) sunrises, sunsets, nature, watching Forensic Files, autumn, The North Shore, hanging out with my girlfriends, and enjoying my new-found love that took 38 years to find.</p>
